The 33rd verse of the first tantra is one of the most famous and profound verses of the Thirumanthiram. It summarizes the essence of Saiva Siddhanta, the school of Saivism that Thirumoolar belonged to. The verse reads as follows:

This verse expresses the idea that Siva, the supreme reality and the source of all existence, is identical with love, the highest value and the ultimate goal of life. Love is not only an emotion or a relationship, but also a state of being and a way of knowing. To realize Siva is to realize love, and to realize love is to realize oneself. Nothing else matters or exists apart from this love.

The life of Thirumoolar is shrouded in mystery and legend. According to some accounts, he was originally a North Indian sage named Suntaranatha, who came to South India to visit the shrine of Chidambaram. There he met a group of cowherds and decided to stay with them for a while. He left his body in a hollow tree and entered the body of a cowherd named Moolan, who had died of snakebite. He revived Moolan's body and lived as him for many years, composing the Thirumanthiram and teaching yoga to his fellow cowherds.
 
According to another version, he was born as Moolan in a Brahmin family in Madurai. He was initiated into Saivism by his guru Nandidevar and became a great yogi and scholar. He traveled to various holy places and finally settled in Thiruvavaduthurai, where he attained samadhi. He is said to have lived for more than 3000 years by the power of his yoga.
 
Whatever the truth of his origin, Thirumoolar is revered as one of the 18 Siddhars, the great masters of yoga and alchemy who possessed miraculous powers and knowledge. He is also counted among the 63 Nayanmars, the devout devotees of Siva who composed hymns and performed heroic deeds in his name. He is believed to have attained the highest state of realization, where he became one with Siva and love.
