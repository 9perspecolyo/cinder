In this section, we will show you how to use Lotus Suspension Analysis.v5.01c Fuser76 to create and simulate a simple suspension model. We will use a double wishbone suspension as an example, but you can apply the same steps to any other suspension type.

1. Launch the software and select "New" from the "File" menu. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the name and description of your project. Click "OK" to proceed.
2. The main window of the software will open, where you can see four tabs: "Model", "Data", "Run" and "Results". Click on the "Model" tab to start creating your suspension model.
3. On the left side of the window, you can see a tree view of the model components. Right-click on the "Suspension" node and select "Add Suspension" from the pop-up menu. A dialog box will appear where you can choose the suspension type and name. Select "Double Wishbone" from the drop-down list and enter a name for your suspension. Click "OK" to add it to your model.
4. On the right side of the window, you can see a graphical representation of your suspension model. You can zoom in or out, pan or rotate the view using the mouse or the toolbar buttons. You can also change the display options using the "View" menu.
5. Double-click on any component of your suspension model to edit its properties. A dialog box will appear where you can enter or modify the values of various parameters, such as dimensions, masses, inertias, stiffnesses, dampings, etc. You can also use the sliders or the buttons to adjust the values. Click "OK" to save your changes.
6. Repeat step 5 for all the components of your suspension model until you are satisfied with their properties. You can also add or delete components using the right-click menu or the toolbar buttons.
7. Click on the "Data" tab to enter or modify the data for your simulation. You can enter or modify the values of various inputs, such as road profile, vehicle speed, steering angle, braking force, etc. You can also use predefined data sets or import data from external files using the toolbar buttons.
8. Click on the "Run" tab to start your simulation. You can choose between two modes: "Single Run" or "Parametric Study". In "Single Run" mode, you can run one simulation with the current data and view the results immediately. In "Parametric Study" mode, you can run multiple simulations with different values of one or more parameters and compare the results later.
9. Click on the "Results" tab to view and analyze the results of your simulation. You can choose between various types of plots and reports using the toolbar buttons or the "Results" menu. You can also export or print the results using the toolbar buttons or the "File" menu.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and simulated a simple suspension model using Lotus Suspension Analysis.v5.01c Fuser76. You can now explore more features and capabilities of this software by creating and simulating more complex and realistic suspension models. Have fun!
