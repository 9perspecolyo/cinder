FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, which is a type of audio compression that reduces the file size without losing any data or quality. Unlike MP3 or AAC formats, which use lossy compression and discard some information to save space, FLAC retains all the details and nuances of the original sound. This means that listening to FLAC files is like listening to the original CD or vinyl records, with no degradation or distortion.
