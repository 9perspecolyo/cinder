The film is a mockumentary that uses hidden cameras and real-life interactions to create hilarious and shocking scenes. Borat is an outrageous and offensive character who says and does things that are politically incorrect, sexist, racist and anti-Semitic. He often provokes strong reactions from the people he meets, who are unaware that he is an actor.
 
Borat was a critical and commercial success, earning over $260 million worldwide and winning a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. It also sparked controversy and lawsuits from some of the people who appeared in the film. The film was praised for its satire of American culture and its social commentary on topics such as racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism.
 
Borat is available to rent or buy on Prime Video[^1^]. You can also watch a video explanation of the film in Hindi on YouTube[^2^]. If you are looking for a similar film with an Indian twist, you might want to check out Barot House[^3^], a 2019 thriller about a family that is torn apart by a series of gruesome killings.

Some of the most memorable scenes in Borat include Borat's interview with a feminist group, his visit to a rodeo where he sings the Kazakh national anthem, his stay at a bed and breakfast owned by a Jewish couple, his wrestling match with his producer Azamat in a hotel, and his attempt to kidnap Pamela Anderson at a book signing.
 
The film also features some celebrities who play themselves, such as Anderson, politician Bob Barr, and etiquette coach Cindy Streit. Some of the people who appeared in the film later sued the filmmakers for defamation, fraud and invasion of privacy. However, most of the lawsuits were dismissed or settled out of court.
 
Borat was followed by a sequel in 2020, titled Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. The sequel follows Borat as he returns to America with his daughter Tutar, played by Maria Bakalova, to deliver her as a gift to Vice President Mike Pence. The sequel also features hidden camera pranks and exposes the political and social issues of America during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.
