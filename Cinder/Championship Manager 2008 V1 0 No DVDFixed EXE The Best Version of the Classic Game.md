# How to Play Championship Manager 2008 Without a CD
 
If you are a fan of Championship Manager 2008, you might have encountered a problem when trying to play the game without a CD. The game requires a CD to run, but sometimes you might not have access to it or you might want to avoid the hassle of inserting and ejecting the disc every time. Fortunately, there is a solution for this: you can use a No-CD patch or a No-DVD/Fixed EXE file to bypass the CD check and play the game without a disc.
 
A No-CD patch or a No-DVD/Fixed EXE file is a modified version of the game's executable file that removes the CD check and allows you to run the game without a disc. You can download these files from various websites that offer game fixes and patches. However, you need to be careful and make sure that the file you download matches your game version and language, and that it does not contain any viruses or malware. You also need to backup your original game files before replacing them with the modified ones, in case something goes wrong or you want to restore them later.
