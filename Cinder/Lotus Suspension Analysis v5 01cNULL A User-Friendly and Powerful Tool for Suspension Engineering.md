Lotus Suspension Analysis v5 01cNULL is a software application that allows engineers to model and analyze the geometric and kinematic properties of any suspension system. The software is developed by Lotus Engineering, a world leader in vehicle ride and handling. Lotus Suspension Analysis v5 01cNULL is based on the SHARK module, which stands for Suspension Handling And Ride Kinematics.

The software has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to apply changes to the proposed geometry and instantaneously assess their impact through graphical results. The software can handle any type of suspension configuration, including independent, dependent, passive, active, and semi-active systems. The software can also perform dynamic analysis, load transfer analysis, compliance analysis, and optimization of suspension parameters.
 
Lotus Suspension Analysis v5 01cNULL is a powerful tool for suspension design and optimization that can help engineers achieve better performance, comfort, safety, and durability of their vehicles. The software is compatible with Windows operating systems and requires a valid license file to run. The software can be purchased from Lotus Engineering by contacting lesoftsupport@lotuscars.com.
  
One of the main challenges of suspension design is to balance the conflicting requirements of handling and ride comfort. Handling refers to the vehicle's ability to respond to the driver's inputs and to maintain stability and control in different driving situations. Ride comfort refers to the vehicle's ability to isolate the occupants from road disturbances and vibrations. A good suspension system should provide both good handling and good ride comfort, but these two objectives often require opposite design choices.
 
For example, a stiff suspension system can improve handling by reducing body roll and improving cornering grip, but it can also degrade ride comfort by transmitting more road shocks and noise to the cabin. Conversely, a soft suspension system can improve ride comfort by absorbing more road irregularities and smoothing out the ride, but it can also degrade handling by increasing body roll and reducing steering response. Therefore, suspension designers have to find a compromise between these two aspects, depending on the intended use and performance of the vehicle.

Another challenge of suspension design is to account for the various forces and loads that act on the suspension system during different driving conditions. These include vertical forces due to gravity and road inputs, longitudinal forces due to braking and acceleration, lateral forces due to cornering and side wind, and torque forces due to drive and braking torque. These forces can affect the suspension geometry, alignment, stiffness, damping, and tire contact patch, which in turn can affect the vehicle's handling and ride characteristics. Therefore, suspension designers have to consider how these forces interact with each other and with the suspension components, and how they can be managed or minimized by using appropriate design parameters and features.
