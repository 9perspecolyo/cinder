Another drawback of Deep Freeze Standard 7.61.020.4320 is that it can interfere with some software updates and installations that require a reboot. If you freeze your system and try to install or update a software that needs a reboot, the changes will not be applied and you may encounter errors or compatibility issues. Therefore, you should always thaw your system before installing or updating any software that requires a reboot.
 
Finally, Deep Freeze Standard 7.61.020.4320 can also cause some inconvenience and confusion if you forget to thaw your system when you want to make permanent changes or save your work.

Therefore, you should always remember to thaw your system when you want to make permanent changes or save your work.
