Pilsner Urquell Game is not only a fun way to enjoy the beer, but also a way to learn about its history and culture. Pilsner Urquell is the world's first pale lager, which revolutionized the brewing industry and inspired countless imitations. The name Pilsner Urquell means "the original source of Pilsner" in German, and it reflects the pride and tradition of the brewery.
 
The story of Pilsner Urquell began in 1838, when the citizens of PlzeÅ, a city in western Bohemia, were dissatisfied with the quality of their local beer. They decided to build a new brewery and hire a Bavarian brewer named Josef Groll, who brought with him the skills and ingredients to make a bottom-fermented lager. On 5 October 1842, Groll brewed the first batch of Pilsner Urquell, using soft water from PlzeÅ, pale malt from Moravia, Saaz hops from Å½atec, and a special yeast strain from Bavaria.
 
The result was a clear, golden beer with a crisp and refreshing taste, balanced by a floral and spicy hop aroma. It was unlike any beer that had been brewed before, and it quickly became popular among the people of PlzeÅ and beyond. Pilsner Urquell was soon exported to other countries and regions, such as Vienna, Paris, London, and America. It also inspired many other brewers to copy its style and name, creating the category of pilsner or pilsener beers that are still widely consumed today.

However, Pilsner Urquell remains the original and authentic pilsner beer, with a distinctive character and quality that sets it apart from its imitators. The brewery still uses the same recipe and ingredients as in 1842, and still brews the beer in the same way, using open fermentation tanks and lagering it in wooden barrels in underground cellars. The brewery also preserves some of its historical buildings and equipment, such as the old copper kettles and the original ice house. Visitors can take a tour of the brewery and see how Pilsner Urquell is made, as well as taste it fresh from the source.
