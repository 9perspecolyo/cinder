The book traces Nash's life from his childhood in West Virginia, where he showed an early interest in mathematics and science, to his studies at Princeton University, where he made groundbreaking contributions to game theory, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. It also chronicles his personal struggles with mental illness, which began in his late twenties and led to his institutionalization, divorce, and estrangement from his family and colleagues. The book also describes Nash's remarkable recovery in the 1990s, when he resumed his academic work and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994.
 
The book is based on extensive interviews with Nash, his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as archival research and medical records. Nasar portrays Nash as a complex and fascinating person, who was both brilliant and troubled, arrogant and humble, rational and irrational. She also explores the nature of genius, creativity, madness, and love in this compelling and inspiring story.

It also provides insights into the social and political context of Nash's work, such as the Cold War, the McCarthy era, the RAND Corporation, and the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study.
 
The book also explores the relationship between Nash and his wife Alicia, who stood by him through his illness and helped him recover. The book depicts their love story as one of courage, sacrifice, and devotion. It also shows how Alicia supported Nash's intellectual pursuits and encouraged him to reconnect with his son John Jr., who also suffered from schizophrenia. The book also features other important figures in Nash's life, such as his mentors John von Neumann and Albert Einstein, his friends Martin Shubik and Norman Steenrod, his rivals Lloyd Shapley and David Gale, and his admirers Harold Kuhn and Reinhard Selten.
