HFSS Antenna Design Kit (ADK) is a software tool that helps you design and analyze antennas using Ansys HFSS, a powerful electromagnetic simulation software. HFSS ADK provides a library of common antenna geometries that you can easily modify and customize according to your specifications. You can also create your own antenna models from scratch using the HFSS 3D modeler. HFSS ADK allows you to quickly evaluate the performance of your antenna designs, such as gain, radiation pattern, polarization, impedance and beam width.

In this article, we will show you how to install and use HFSS ADK to design and simulate an example antenna. We will use HFSS ADK version 2.1, which is compatible with HFSS 15.0 and later versions.
 
## How to Install HFSS ADK
 
To install HFSS ADK, you need to have HFSS installed on your computer. You can download HFSS ADK from the Ansys website or from the link provided in the reference section[^1^]. After downloading the zip file, extract it to a folder of your choice. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Open HFSS and go to Tools > Options > Component Libraries.
2. Click on Add Library and browse to the folder where you extracted HFSS ADK.
3. Select the file named "HFSS\_Antenna\_Design\_Kit\_v2\_1.aedtlib" and click Open.
4. Click OK to close the Options window.
5. Restart HFSS to load the HFSS ADK library.

## How to Use HFSS ADK
 
To use HFSS ADK, you need to create a new project in HFSS and select the appropriate design type. For example, if you want to design a microstrip patch antenna, you need to select "Driven Terminal" as the design type. Then, follow these steps:

1. Go to Project > Insert HFSS Design.
2. In the Project Manager window, right-click on the new design and rename it as you wish.
3. In the Modeler window, go to Draw > 3D Components > Antennas > HFSS Antenna Design Kit.
4. A new window will pop up with a list of antenna categories and types. Select the category and type of antenna that you want to design. For example, if you want to design a microstrip patch antenna, select "Planar Antennas" as the category and "Rectangular Patch" as the type.
5. Click OK to insert the antenna model into your design.
6. In the Modeler window, you can see the antenna geometry and its parameters. You can modify the parameters as you wish by double-clicking on them or by using the Properties window.
7. To set up the simulation, go to Analysis > Setup Analysis Options. Here you can specify the frequency range, mesh settings, solution type and other options for your simulation.
8. To assign boundary conditions and ports to your antenna model, go to Excitations > Assign Excitation. Here you can select from different types of excitations, such as lumped ports, wave ports or incident fields. For example, if you want to feed your microstrip patch antenna with a coaxial cable, you need to assign a lumped port to the feed point of your antenna.
9. To run the simulation, go to Analysis > Analyze All. This will start solving your design and generate results.
10. To view the results, go to Results > Create Modal Solution Data Report. Here you can select from different types of reports, such as S-parameters, far fields, near fields or radiation patterns. For example, if you want to see the gain and radiation pattern of your microstrip patch antenna, you need to select "Far Fields" as the report type and "Gain/ Directivity" as the plot type.
