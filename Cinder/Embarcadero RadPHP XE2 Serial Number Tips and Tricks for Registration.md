### Designing the User Interface
 
To design the user interface of your web application, you can use the Form Designer and the Tool Palette. The Form Designer shows a visual representation of your web page, where you can add and arrange components such as buttons, labels, text boxes, grids, charts, and more. The Tool Palette contains a list of components that you can drag and drop to the Form Designer.
 
To add a component to your web page, follow these steps:

1. Select the component from the Tool Palette.
2. Drag and drop it to the desired location on the Form Designer.
3. Use the Object Inspector to change the properties and events of the component. For example, you can change the caption, color, font, size, alignment, and visibility of a component.
4. Use the Alignment Palette to align and distribute components on your web page. For example, you can align components to the left, right, top, or bottom edges of the Form Designer or other components.

### Writing the Code
 
To write the code for your web application, you can use the Code Editor and the Code Explorer. The Code Editor allows you to write PHP code using syntax highlighting, code completion, code folding, code templates, and more. The Code Explorer shows a tree view of your project files and their contents, such as classes, functions, variables, and constants.
 
To write code for a component event, follow these steps:

1. Select the component on the Form Designer or in the Object Inspector.
2. Select the event that you want to handle from the Events tab of the Object Inspector. For example, you can select OnClick for a button component.
3. Double-click on the event name. The Code Editor will open with a stub for the event handler function.
4. Write your code inside the event handler function. For example, you can write code to perform some action when a button is clicked.
