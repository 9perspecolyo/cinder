# Skanda Sashti Kavasam: A Powerful Hymn to Lord Murugan
 
Skanda Sashti Kavasam is a Tamil devotional song composed by Devaraya Swamigal in praise of Lord Murugan, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. The word Kavasam means a shield or armor that protects the wearer from harm. The song consists of 244 lines that describe the glory, attributes and blessings of Lord Murugan.
 
Skanda Sashti Kavasam is recited by devotees during the Skanda Sashti festival, which is celebrated for six days in the month of Aippasi (October-November) in the Tamil calendar. The festival commemorates the victory of Lord Murugan over the demon Surapadma and his army. On the sixth day, which is known as Soorasamharam, Lord Murugan slays Surapadma with his spear (Vel) and liberates the devas from his tyranny.
