# How to Activate GTA 4 Offline Using an .exe File
 
GTA 4 is a popular action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games[^3^]. It requires activation to play on PC, which is a mandatory process for all installations of GTA 4 PC, regardless of format[^1^]. However, some users may not have access to the internet or a Key Management Server (KMS) to activate their game online. In this case, they can use an offline activation method using an .exe file.

GTA 4 is set in a fictional version of New York City called Liberty City, where the player controls Niko Bellic, an Eastern European war veteran who comes to America in search of the American Dream. Along the way, he gets involved in various criminal activities and encounters many characters from different backgrounds and factions. The game features a realistic and detailed open world that can be explored on foot or by using various vehicles. The game also has a multiplayer mode that allows up to 32 players to compete or cooperate in different game modes.
 
Offline activation is a useful option for users who do not have a stable or reliable internet connection or who prefer to keep their privacy and security. However, offline activation also has some drawbacks and limitations. For example, users may need to update their game manually or download patches from other sources. Users may also face compatibility issues with some mods or online features that require online verification. Users should also be careful about where they download the offline activation .exe file from, as some sources may contain malware or viruses that can harm their PC.
